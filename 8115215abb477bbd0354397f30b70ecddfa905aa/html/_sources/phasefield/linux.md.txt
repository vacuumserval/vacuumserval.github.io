Richard Matthew Stallman (1953-) is an American programmer and free software movement activist. Stallman launched the GNU (*GNU is Not Unix*) Project, founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985, to campaign for software to be distributed in such a manner that its users have the freedom to use, study, distribute, and modify that software, a.k.a, the *"free software"*.
